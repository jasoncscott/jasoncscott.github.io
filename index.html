    <p>
        My name is Jason Scott – not to be confused with
        (<a href="http://www.powerrangers.com/character/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-jason-lee-scott-red-ranger-season-1/">
        Jason Lee Scott</a>) (although I did work on <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3717490">
        Power Rangers</a></em>) nor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001462/">Jason Scott Lee</a> (although we do
        share one screen credit for <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1121096/">Seventh Son</a></em>).  In fact,
        my name is so common, they made a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469144/">movie</a> about it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I ❤️ <em><a href="https://www.starwars.com/">Star Wars</a></em>, VFX and 🎥, and I've lived in 🇺🇸 🇩🇪 🇨🇦 🇦🇺.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a seasoned technology manager and creative supervisor in the VFX/animation industry, with a background
        that includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Production technology for multiple studios with ~1000 artists across locations</li>
        <li>Head of 3D for ~75 artists, working on multiple shows simultaneously</li>
        <li>Pipeline lead supporting projects spanning both features and commercials</li>
        <li>Digital FX Supervisor for full-CG, 360°, stereo imagery for "5D" theme park ride</li>
        <li>Lighting Supervisor for 200+ shot shows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But I not only have extensive experience—I absolutely love what I'm doing! I am constantly enthralled by the
        magic that is visual effects and animation, and for me, it's the perfect combination of art and technology,
        working together to create imagery that otherwise couldn't be shown on screen. That blend is a perfect match
        for me, as I feel just as comfortable tackling artistic challenges as technical ones.

    <p>
        I most recently worked with the entire <a href="https://www.pitchblackcompany.com/">Pitch Black</a> group
        (combining <a href="https://www.fusefx.com/">FuseFX</a>, <a href="https://www.folksvfx.com/">Folks</a>,
        <a href="https://www.rsp.com.au/">Rising Sun Pictures</a>, and <a href="https://www.elranchito    .es/">El
        Ranchito</a>, having previously been the Head of 3D and Head of Technology at RSP.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prior to my time at Pitch Black and RSP, I was at <a href="https://www.methodstudios.com/">Method Studios</a>
        for a few years, and at <a href="https://www.rhythm.com/">Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios</a> for many years. Before
        R&amp;H, it starts to get murky--some years at <a href="https://www.dr    eamworksanimation.com/">DreamWorks</a>,
        some time working for <a href="https://www.stanwistonschool.com/stan-winston-studio">Stan Winston</a> (even
        doing a couple of stints in animatronics), a stint as a VFX Supervisor for a Lifetime TV show (because you all
        know how many VFX shots are in L    ifetime TV shows...), and even some visualization for the U.S. Air Force.
    </p>

    <p>
        I attended the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a> ✌️.
