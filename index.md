My name is Jason Scott ‚Äì not to be confused with [Jason Lee Scott](http://www.powerrangers.com/character/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-jason-lee-scott-red-ranger-season-1/) (although I did work on _[Power Rangers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3717490)_) nor [Jason Scott Lee](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001462/) (although we do share one screen credit for _[Seventh Son](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1121096/)_).  In fact, my name is so common, they made a [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469144/) about it.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è _[Star Wars](https://www.starwars.com/)_, VFX and :movie_camera:, and I've lived in <img src="https://flagsapi.com/US/flat/16.png">(üá∫üá∏) <img src="https://flagsapi.com/DE/flat/16.png">(üá©üá™) <img src="https://flagsapi.com/CA/flat/16.png">(üá®üá¶) <img src="https://flagsapi.com/AU/flat/16.png">(üá¶üá∫).

I am a seasoned technology manager and creative supervisor in the VFX/animation industry, with a background that includes:
* Production technology for multiple studios with ~1000 artists across locations
* Head of 3D for ~75 artists, working on multiple shows simultaneously
* Pipeline lead supporting projects spanning both features and commercials
* Digital FX Supervisor for full-CG, 360¬∞, stereo imagery for "5D" theme park ride
* Lighting Supervisor for 200+ shot shows

But I not only have extensive experience‚ÄîI absolutely love what I'm doing! I am constantly enthralled by the magic that is visual effects and animation, and for me, it's the perfect combination of art and technology, working together to create imagery that otherwise couldn't be shown on screen. That blend is a perfect match for me, as I feel just as comfortable tackling artistic challenges as technical ones.

I currently work at [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/) on the [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/) engine team.  Prior to Blizzard, I worked with the entire [Pitch Black](https://www.pitchblackcompany.com/) group (combining [FuseFX](https://www.fusefx.com/), [Folks](https://www.folksvfx.com/), [Rising Sun Pictures](https://www.rsp.com.au/), and [El Ranchito](https://www.elranchito.es/)), having previously been the Head of 3D and Head of Technology at RSP.

Before my time at Pitch Black and RSP, I was at [Method Studios](https://www.methodstudios.com/) for a few years, and at [Rhythm & Hues Studios](https://www.rhythm.com/) for many years. Before R&H, it starts to get murky--some years at [DreamWorks](https://www.dreamworksanimation.com/), some time working for [Stan Winston](https://www.stanwistonschool.com/stan-winston-studio) (even doing a couple of stints in animatronics), a stint as a VFX Supervisor for a Lifetime TV show (because you all know how many VFX shots are in Lifetime TV shows...), and even some visualization for the U.S. Air Force.

I attended the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) :v:.
